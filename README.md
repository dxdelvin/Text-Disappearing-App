Welcome to the Text Disappearing App repository! This simple Python application, built using Tkinter, offers a unique twist to text editing â€“ the text disappears if left unchanged for a certain period.

git clone https://github.com/dxdelvin/Text-Disappearing-App.git

2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the cloned directory:

## Usage
1. Upon running the application, you'll see a window titled "Text Disappearing App".
2. Write your text in the provided text area.
3. If there's no activity for a while, the text will disappear, signaling you to continue writing.
4. Experience this behavior by running the application and pausing your writing.
5. The application continually monitors text changes. If no changes occur for 2 seconds, it replaces the text with "Text is Lost".
